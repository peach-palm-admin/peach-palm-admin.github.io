The website is set up using the `/docs/` folder using jekyll and served using github pages.

The `/DOCUMENTS/` folder contains files for human use - it is just logos for now.

Website philosophy:

* keep it simple and clean
* Professional but a little fun
* should feel calm. Calm is something we bring to their hectic mess
